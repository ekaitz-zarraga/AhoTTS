Text-to-Speech software for Basque and Spanish
----------------------------------------------

Text-to-Speech conversor for Basque and Spanish. It includes linguistic
processing and built voices for the languages aforementioned. Its acoustic
engine is based on hts_engine and it uses a high quality vocoder called
AhoCoder. Developed by Aholab Signal Processing Laboratory, at the Bilbao
School of Engineering (University of the Basque Country).

This project is a fork of the original one. I tried to organize the project a
little bit better, making it easier to package and install. Most of the work is
done in the CMake scripts.
